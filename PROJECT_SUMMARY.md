## 📝 Detailed Summary (Paragraph Format)

Engineered a comprehensive word classification and pattern matching system in C that demonstrates proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and file I/O operations. The application reads text from files (including classic literature samples), organizes words into length-based linked lists (4-12 characters), and implements a sophisticated sequential character matching algorithm to identify parent words containing subset character patterns. The system features dynamic memory management, duplicate removal algorithms, and CSV parsing capabilities. Key accomplishments include processing 1000+ words efficiently, implementing multiple linked list structures for optimized search operations, and creating a robust file handling system that validates alphabetic-only input while stripping punctuation.

## 💡 Interview Talking Points

When discussing this project in interviews, emphasize:

1. **Problem-Solving**: "I identified that organizing words by length first would optimize searches, since subset words can only have parents of equal or greater length."

2. **Data Structures**: "I chose linked lists over arrays because they provide O(1) insertion without needing to know the size upfront, which is perfect for text processing."

3. **Algorithm Design**: "The sequential character matching algorithm scans each parent word once, making it efficient with O(m) complexity per word."

4. **Memory Management**: "Working in C taught me the importance of proper memory management - I implemented careful malloc/free pairing and validated zero memory leaks."
